# Pong
just simple 2 player Pong, made in python using Pygame

I used Pygame Community Eddition due to pygame being blocked on my college network where i developed this program, however i dont think this changes anything as far as im aware.

I do not plsn change this simply because its pong there is only so much you can do with it, I might make this a "classic" eddition and make a new version with powers up and AI opponent mabye, however, I want to move on to some other projects.

I wrote this program diffrently to my typical method, usually my programs are made almost entirely of functions, however, Pong is almost entirely written top-down with a singular loop.

## controls
left paddle:
  w = up
  s = down
right paddle:
  arrow key up = up
  arrow key down = down

good luck getting confused
