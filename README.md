# Pong
just Pong, made in python using Pygame

I used Pygame Community Eddition due to pygame being blocked on my college network where i developed this program, however i dont think this cnhanges anything as far as im aware.

I do not plsn change this simply because its pong there is only so much you can do with it, I might make this a "classic" eddition and make a new version with powers up however, i want to move on to some other projects
